Unicart is a website developed to allow price comparison between items from different e-commerce platforms/sites.
The current number of sites are 2 i.e:
- jiji.ug
- jumia.ug

Unicart enables the comparison by retrieving items from a database that are retrieved through webscrapping from their respective sites.
The current scope of the items include, but aren't limited to, mobile phones.

Aside from comparison, a user can also browse, select a particular item and view/analyse its details/specs.

Future implementations are in works to improve the efficiency and overall userbality of the site.
